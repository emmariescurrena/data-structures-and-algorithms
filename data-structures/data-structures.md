# Data Structures

## What is a data structure?
A data structure is a way to store data.
## Why are so many data structures?
Because different data structures are useful for different things and also exists special algorithms for different data structures.
## What types of data structures exist?
Exist 2 types of data structures:
- **Linear**: Is a data structure that has his elements ordered sequentially and can be traversed in one run. Are asy to implement, but the time complexity scales with the size. Some examples are [[array]], [[stack]], [[queue]] and [[stack]].
- **Non-linear**: Is a data structure that isn't ordered sequentially and needs multiple runs to be traversed. These are more comple, but can be more efficient for large amount of data. Some examples are [[graph]] and [[tree]].
