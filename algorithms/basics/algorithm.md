# Algorithm

## What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a **serie of steps**, made to **solve a particular problem**.
## Which are the main parts of an algorithm?
An algorithm is composed by an **input**, a **process** and an **output**. For example, to make a bake:
- Input: Eggs, flour, butter, etc.
- Process: Mix ingredients, turn on the oven, etc.
- Output: Bake.
## Which characteristics needs to have an algorithm?
- Input and output need to be **well defined**.
- Steps need to be **clear and unambiguous**.
- Among many other ways to solve a problem, the algorithm needs to be the **most effective**
- An algorithm is written in **human-readable content**, not in code.

## Why learn algorithms?
Being good at algorithms allows:
- Making code scalable
- Using computer resources efficiently
